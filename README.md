# robotaudition_examples
Some Robot Audition simplified examples (sound source localization and separation), coded in Octave/Matlab.

For sound localization:
* Generalized Cross Correlation with Phase Transform (GCC-PHAT)
* Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC)

For sound separation:
* Delay-and-Sum (DAS)
* Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR)
* Linearly Constrained Minimum Variance (LCMV)
* Generalized Sidelobe Canceller (GSC), time and frequency variations, and with a dynamic SNR-based gradient
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA), time and frequency variations
* Independent Component Analysis (ICA), time and frequency variations
* Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NNMF), time varaition and incomplete frequency variations (magnitude and by parts)
* Phase-based frequency masking (PHASE)

Should run in an Octave installation with the "signal" package installed.
